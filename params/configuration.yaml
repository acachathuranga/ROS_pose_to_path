# Format:
#	path1: [poseTopic, pathTopic, publish_rate, sample_rate]
#	path2: [poseTopic, pathTopic, publish_rate, sample_rate]
#
# Example:
#	path0: [myPoseTopic, myPathTopic, 0.3, 2]
#
# Note:
#	Path count starts from 0
#	Publish and sample rates are in Hz
#
# To sample at pose_message rate, set sample_rate to 0 (Otherwise leave this empty)
# To publish path at sample rate, set publish_rate to 0 (Otherwise leave this empty)

path0: ['HumanPose', 'HumanPath', 0, 5]

path3: ['UAV3Pose', 'UAV3Path', 0, 5]

# If specified, only the last number of seconds specified below will be visualized in the path
# If not specified or set to 0, full path will be visualized
